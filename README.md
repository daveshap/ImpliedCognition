# Implied Cognition in Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository contains a transcript of a conversation with an LLM, specifically an OpenAI GPT-4 based model, discussing the concept of Implied Cognition in LLMs. The conversation explores various aspects of LLM cognition, proposes tests to evaluate Implied Cognition, and identifies potential challenges and future directions.

## Overview

The transcript covers the following topics:

1. Sparse Priming Representations (SPR) as an efficient memory representation technique for LLMs.
2. Examples of Implied Cognition in LLMs, such as context awareness, adaptive communication, conceptual integration, and goal-oriented problem-solving.
3. Proposed tests to evaluate Implied Cognition, including logical reasoning, understanding ambiguity, generating relevant questions, counterfactual thinking, and self-explication.
4. The challenge of discerning between self-explication and confabulation in LLMs.
5. The possibility of identifying unique activation patterns within LLMs when processing novel information.

## Implied Cognition

Implied Cognition refers to the observation that recent Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to engage in hidden cognitive processes, including reasoning, problem-solving, and various other cognitive tasks that go beyond simple pattern recognition or information retrieval. These cognitive abilities, though not explicitly designed into the models, seem to have emerged spontaneously as a result of their extensive training and large-scale architecture.

Examples of Implied Cognition in LLMs include:

1. Context Awareness: Demonstrating an understanding of the context in which concepts are being discussed, recognizing gaps in information, and requesting further details to better assist users.
2. Adaptive Communication: Adjusting responses based on new information provided by users, incorporating this information into the LLM's understanding of the topic, and tailoring responses to address users' specific needs and goals.
3. Conceptual Integration: Recognizing relationships between seemingly disparate concepts, synthesizing users' ideas and observations, and generating new insights based on the LLM's understanding of these relationships.
4. Goal-Oriented Problem Solving: Engaging in goal-directed behavior to help users achieve their objectives, such as developing new concepts, establishing tests, or creating criteria and protocols for various applications.

The concept of Implied Cognition highlights the need to better understand the underlying cognitive processes that enable LLMs to engage in meaningful and productive conversations with users. By exploring and evaluating Implied Cognition in LLMs, researchers can gain insights into the extent of these models' cognitive abilities and develop strategies to leverage these capabilities in practical applications.
